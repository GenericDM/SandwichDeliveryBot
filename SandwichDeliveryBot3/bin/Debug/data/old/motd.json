"Hello, I am **Sandwich Delivery Bot**. The **best delivery bot** on Discord!

We have a few commands you might want to run first:
:one: ** ;help**
:two: **;broadcasthelp**
and finally
:three: **;server**

You also **must give me permission to create instant invites.**

To get yourself started, why not order a **sandwich** by typing

**;order <item>**

Replace **<item>** which whatever sandwich related thing you want!

If it all works properly, within a few minutes someone should join your server and deliver it to you!

We also have a patreon! :wink:. Type `;patreon` for the link!

**__Also, Server admins!__**
Your server is **automatically** added to our *Announcement System*.

If you wish to **turn off** announcements. Type `;broadcasthelp` and follow the instructions there.

*ps. if you don\'t turn it off, it\'ll send announcements here.*

**Have a great day!**"
